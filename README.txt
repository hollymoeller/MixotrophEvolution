This directory contains MATLAB code and data needed to reproduce the model simulations contained in the manuscript. This is a mechanistic model of mixotroph growth and respiration based on a set of differential equations that describe short-term, plastic changes to metabolic strategy and long-term, evolutionary changes to respiration under variable temperature conditions. The model was used to simulate changes to metabolic activity at different temperatures under evolutionary and non-evolutionary scenarios.
